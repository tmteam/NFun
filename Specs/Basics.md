# Nfun Basics

### Basic definitions

Output variable (output) is a named value calculated in the script

```py
x = 1 # 'x' is the output
```

Input variable (input) - a named value known before the script execution

```py
x = i + 1 # 'i' is the input
```

Expression is a description of calculating a value of some type. Numbers, text, formulas, and function calls are all particular cases of expressions

```py
2*(i-12).toText() # expression with type of text
```

Initialization of the variable (output) - assigning the value of the expression to the output
```py
x = 2*(3-1).toText() #value '4' type 'text' is assigned to the output 'x'
```
Type declaration - explicit indication of the type of the variable
```py
i:int # type declaration for input i
x:text = i.toText() # type declaration for x output combined with its initialization
```
User function - the function described in the script
```py
myFunc(a,b) = 2*a+b #example of a custom function
```

# Nfun script

The Nfun script can only consist of the following elements:
- Initialization (assignment) of output variables
- Declarations of input variable types
- Descriptions of user functions
- Comments
- Variable annotations

Each of these elements begins with a new line, In this case, symbol ';' is the full equivalent of a line break.

The exception is the 'Comment', which can not only start with a new line, but can also be placed at the end of any of the script lines. Symbol ';' does not end the comment.

The script is executed from top to bottom. This means that:
- The declaration of the input variable (if it exists) must be placed before any of its usage in expressions
- Initialization of the output variable must be placed before any its usage in expressions

A custom function can be declared both before or after its use

Script example:
```py
# Inputs: a,b,myInput
# Outputs: incrementResult, someSum, isBig
# Custom function: sumOf3(x,y,z)

a:int; b:int # Declaration of the types of input variables a and b

incrementResult = a+1 # Initializing the output incrementResult
someSum:int64 = sumOf3(a,b,1) #Calling the user function

isBig = someSum > myInput #Using an undeclared input

@best_variable_ever  
theTruth = true # output 'theTruth' has annotation 'best_variable_ever' whatever that means

sumOf3(x,y,z) = x+y+z #userFunction sumOf3

```

# Script execution

Regardless of the API with which the script is called, the script lifecycle is divided into several stages. This separation may be hidden from you using the API, but this information may be useful for understanding the work of Nfun

1) **Construction**. Checking the correctness of the script and calculating the types of all expressions in the script
2) **Setting inputs**. The Client code sets the values of the inputs
3) **Execution**. Calculating the values of all outputs
4) Getting variable values by client code 

After construction, the script can be repeatedly executed with the setting of new input values.
At the same time, it is guaranteed that there is no hidden, changing state between successive launches, since all variables are immutable.

# Variables

Variable names consist of uppercase and lowercase latin letters, numbers, and the _ symbol. The first character must be a latin letter

For example: 'x', 'my_Name', 'id32'

Nfun is case sensitive for variables, but you cannot create two variables whose names differ only by case

```py
x = 123
y = X+1 # Error. it is not possible to create an input X, 
        # since the variable x has already been declared
```

All variables in NFun are 'immutable', which means that output variables can only be initialized once,
and input variables cannot be initialized at all.

### Output variables

Each output variable is initialized by an expression.
The output type can be declared only during initialization

```py
x = 2*3 # the output of 'x' is initialized with the expression '2*3'

y:text = (x+input).toText() # output 'y' of type 'text' with explicit type declartion 
                            # is initialized with an expression
```

The output can be (repeatedly) used in the expressions following after its initialization

```py
a = 42
b = a+1
```

### Anonymous output

If there is only one output variable, it can be initialized simply by writing an expression (without specifying the name and the '=' symbol). 
In this case, an anonymous output named 'out' will be created

```py
2*(3-1) # is equivalent to 'out = 2*(3-1)'
```
```py
x ** 2 # is equivalent to 'out = x ** 2'
```
```py
x:text
x.reverse() # is equivalent to 'out = x.reverse()'
```


### Input variables

Any uninitialized variable in the script is considered an input. 
```py
x = i +1 # 'i' is the input.
```
So the input cannot be initialized
```py
x = i +1 
i = 2 # Error. The input cannot be initialized
```
The input variable may have explicit type declaration
```py
inputName:type #input type declaration 'inputName' with type 'type'
```
The type declaration of the input must be described strictly before its first use

```py
i:int # i has the type int
x = i +1
```

The input variable can be repeatedly used in the calculation of output variables

```py
x = i + 2*i
y = i/2
```

## Comments

Comment - the text following the # character and ending with the end of the line (the character ; does not interrupt the comment). The comment text is completely ignored by the interpreter:

```py
# this is a comment

y = 1+2 # this is also a comment

# the following code will be ignored: z = 5+4
```

# Expressions

An expression is a description of calculating a value of some type.

An expression is anything from
- literal (discrete, numeric, or textual)
- variable
- template text
- function call
- application of the operator ([], *, +, (), ., and, or, >>, |, and so on)
- default value - 'default'
- anonymous function - 'rule'
- array initializer [...]
- structure initializer {...}
- conditional expression 'if-else'

At the time of script execution - the resulting type of each expression is strictly known and specific (with the exception for generic user functions)
This is also true for nested expressions (all expression nodes have a strict type at the time of execution)

When reading an expression, line breaks are ignored

```py
y = # start of expression
12
*3 ;; # ';' symbol also ignored as it is similar to the line break 
+1 -2 # end of expression
z = true and false
```

### Expressions: Discrete literal

Discrete literals have the **bool** type
There are two discrete literals - **'true'** and **'false'** defining logical truth and false, respectively

### Expressions: Numeric literal

The numbers in NFun can be written in various ways. Supported
- delimiters '_' ,
- decimal literals '.',
- negative numbers '-'
- bitness modifiers '0x' and '0b'

```py
123   # integer literal
-123  # integer literal
1_234 # integer literal with separator

0x123     # hexadecimal literal
-0x123    # hexadecimal literal
0x123_456 # hexadecimal literal with separator

0b123     # binary literal
-0b123    # binary literal
0b123_456 # binary literal with separator

123.456  # real literal
-123.456 # real literal

123_456.7_89 # real literal with separator
```

A real literal always has the **real** type.
For other numeric literals, the same symbol may have different types depending on the context:
```py
i = 1      # int32 since this type is 'preferred' for integer literals

j:byte = 1 # byte since the type is explicitly specified

k = 1      # real, since it only participates in decimal division in the next line
m = 1/k

r = 1.5 #real
```

### Conditional expression 'if-else'

In Nfun, **if-else** is an expression, i.e. it always returns a value

```py
result = if(condition1) expression1 else elseExpression
```
here:
- **condition1** is a bool type expression
- **expression1** is the resulting expression if condition is true
- **elseExpression** is the resulting expression if all conditions are false

Since **elseExpression** can also be an **if-else** expression, many branches of conditions can be implemented:

```py
result = 
	if(c1) e1 # if c1 is true, the result will be e1
	else if(c2) e2 # otherwise, if c2 is true, the result will be e2
	else if(c3) e3 # otherwise, if c3 is true, the result will be e3
	# there can be as many branches as you like
	else elseExpression # otherwise (if all conditions are false), 
	                    # then the result is elseExpression
```

For the case of multiple branches, - Nfun offers a compact if-if-else syntax.
To do this, you can simply replace 'else if' with 'if':

```py
result = 
    if(c1) e1 # if c1 is true, the result will be e1
    if(c2) e2 # otherwise, if c2 is true, the result will be e2
    if(c3) e3 # otherwise, if c3 is true, the result will be e3
    # there can be as many branches as you like
    else elseExpression # otherwise (if all conditions are false), 
                        # then the result will be elseExpression
```

Examples:
```py
a = 
    if(x>0) 'positive'
    if(x<0) 'negative'
    else 'zero'

b = 
    if(a == 'positive' and flag) 
        if(day == 1) 'mon'
        if(day == 2) 'tue'
        if(day == 3) 'wed'
        if(day == 4) 'thu'
        if(day == 5) 'fri'
        if(day == 6) 'sat'
        if(day == 7) 'sun'
        else '???'
    else 'some day'
```

### Expressions: Default value 'default'

Each type has a default value

This value is equal to:
- zero for any numeric type
- empty array for arrays
- " (empty text) for text
- new object() for any
- a structure with a 'default' value for each field in the structure type
- a function that returns the 'default' value for an anonymous function

use the keyword 'default' to get this value

```py
y:real = default #0.0
a = if(1>2) true else default #false

b = if(input>0) [1,2,3] else default

notDefinedFunction(a,b) = default
```

### Expressions: Function call

A function call is an expression that returns the result of executing a function with the specified arguments
There are two forms of function call syntax - classic and reverse


Classic:

```py
#For a function without arguments
functionName()

#For a function with arguments H
functionName(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...argn)
```

Reverse:

```py
#For a function with 1 argument, the argument
arg1.functionName()

#For a function with N arguments
arg1.functionName(arg2, arg3,...argN)
```
Where functionName is the function name, and arg1,arg2, argN are the first second and n-th arguments of the call, respectively

```py
i = reverse("hello") #'olleh'
j = max(1,max(2,3)) #3
k = 'hello'.concat ('world').inverse() #'olle dlrow'
m = i.union(k) #'olleholle'
```

### Expressions: 'rule' lambda-expression 

The NFun supports anonymous functions - **rules**.

The expression following the keyword 'rule' is the body of such a function. If an anonymous function uses one input variable (argument), then the  name of this variable inside the expression is "it"

If there are two or more, then their names are 'it1', 'it2'... 'itN'

```py
f = rule it*2 # expression for an anonymous function multiplying the input argument by 2

f(2) # 4

a = [1,2,3,4].filter(rule>2) # using a rule to filter an array 
                             # only elements strictly larger than 2 will be selected
x = [-1,-2,0,1,2,3].add(rule it1+it2) #sum of all array elements
```

There is an extended form of rule-expression, with the ability to specify the types of arguments and or the type of return value 

```py
rule(arg1:type1, arg2:type2... argN:type):rtype = expression
```
here
* **arg1,arg2..argN** - the names of the 1st 2nd ... N-th arguments
* *(optional)* **type1,type2...type2** - types of the 1st 2nd ... N-th arguments
* *(optional)* **rtype** - function return type
* **expression** - function expression (body) with local variables arg1,arg2..argN

```py
a = [1,2,3].all(rule(i) = i >0)          # check that all numbers in the array are positive
b = [1,2,3].all(rule(i:int):bool = i >0) # check that all numbers in the array are positive 
                                         # (all types explicitly specified)
x = [-1,-2,0,1,2,3]
       .filter(rule(i)= i>0)
       .fold(rule(a:int,b)= a+b) #the sum of all positive integers of the array
```

All variables from the external scope are visible inside the anonymous function. The external variable used inside the **rule** expression is called **captured**  
```py
a = 2
b = [1..100].filter(rule it % a == 0) # a is captured variable inside rule expression
```
### Expressions not described in this document

The remaining expressions require a more detailed description and are described in the following documents:

- Operators
- Arrays
- Lines
- Structures

# Custom functions

In the body of the script, you can describe the function available for calling in the script

```py
functionName(arg1:type1,arg2:type2...argN:type):rtype = expression
```
here
* **functionName** - the name of the function
* **arg1,arg2..argN** - 1st,2nd ... n-th names of arguments
* *(optional)* **type1,type2...typeN** - types of the 1st 2nd ... N-th argument
* *(optional)* **rtype** - function return type
* **expression** - function expression (body) with local variables arg1,arg2..argN

Only function arguments can be used as variables in the function body. The inputs and outputs of the script are not visible for the function 

```py
Sum of 3(a,b,c) = a+b+c

a = sum(1,2,3) #6:int

b = maximum real(1,2,3) #3:real

maxOfReal(a,b,c):real = max(max(a,b),c)

firstPositiveNumber(a:int[]) = if(a. any(rule>0)) a.filter(rule>0)[0] the rest is by default

c = [-1,3,0,-4,5].The first positive number() #3

```

### Specific and generic user functions

In the simplest case, all types of function arguments are strictly defined. This is possible when types are uniquely defined from an expression and/or when types are specifically specified

Such functions are called **specific**

```py
divideBy2(a) = a/2 # the function takes a:real and returns real

multiplyReal(a: real, b) = a*b # the function takes a: real, b: real and returns real

maxOf3(a,b,c):int =max(a,b).max(c) # the function takes a:int, b:int, c:int and returns int
```

If the function is valid for various types (including with some restrictions on them), such a function is called **generic**.

Consider an example of a function of the sum of 3 terms:

```py
threeSum(a,b,c) = a+b+c
```

The + operator is applicable to int32, int64, uint32, uint64, real types.
This means that both the argument types and the return value type are equal to each other and belong to the same range

If you call such a function with different types , then various operations will be performed:

For the real case, it will be real-addition, for int32, it will be int32-addition, etc.:

```py
a:int = threeSum(1,2,3)

barg1: real; barg2:real; barg3:real
b = threeSum(barg1, barg2, barg3)
```

Other examples of generic user functions:

```py
firstItem(a) = if(a.size()>0) a[0] else default

t = 'hello'.firstItem() #\'h'
m = [1,2,3].firstItem() # 1

increment(a) = a+1

i = 0.increment() #1:int
j = 1.5.increment() #1.5:real
k:uint = 12.increment() #13:uint
```

## Variable annotation '@'

Allows you to add meta information to a variable. This information can only be accessed from the calling code
```py
@supermega
a = 42 # a has annotation 'supermega'
```
here 'supermega' - is annotation for output variable 'a'

Annotation name consist of uppercase and lowercase latin letters, numbers, and the _ symbol. 
The first character must be a latin letter

For example: 'private', 'hidden_id', 'id32'

The annotation must be on the line before the variable initialization line or the variable type declaration. Empty lines don't count
Each variable can contain many annotations. Each following annotation should start with a new line
Each annotation can carry one argument - numeric, binary, or text literal inide brackets right after annotation name

```py
@required
@veryFun

i: int # input 'i' has to annotations - 'required' and 'veryFun'

@id('foo')
@private
a = 42 # output 'a' has annotation 'id' with 'foo' value, and annotation 'private' without any value
```
